# Bioinformatics Portfolio

A showcase of bioinformatics pipelines, ML/AI dashboards, and production ready tooling developed by Myren Sutton. This project demonstrates genomic data engineering, visualization, RAG assistants, and cloud based execution.

## Structure
- `pipelines/`: Nextflow variant calling workflows
- `api/`: Flask REST API for genomic data querying
- `dashboard/`: Streamlit dashboard to explore variant and clustering data
- `rag-assistant/`: LangChain powered assistant trained on genomics literature
- `cloud-runner/`: AWS scripts and notebooks for cloud-based processing
